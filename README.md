# Subsii
Subsii is a multi tenant subscription platform for post-delivered content

Subsii will be working in following way: Create a user on subsii.com, generate your webshop, connect your domain, get your design, start selling.
So basically should every tenant be connected to their own domain, but still be in our database, managed by us alone and hosted by us.
To handle bigger changes they will need to use our site, to handle webshop and workflow, they need to login to staff panel on their own site. 
Clients of their site will need a login with a profile too, but on the tenants generated shop.

The overview of logins and user roles:
Subsii.com
- Subsii staff
- Subsii client

Tenants own domain:
- Tenant staff
- Tenant client
